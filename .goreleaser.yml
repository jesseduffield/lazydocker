#    # This the description of your snap. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
#    # most important story about your snap. Keep it under 100 words though,
#    # we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the snap
#    # store.

#
#    # A guardrail to prevent you from releasing a snap to all your users before
#    # it is ready.
#    # `devel` will let you release only to the `edge` and `beta` channels in the
#    # store. `stable` will let you release also to the `candidate` and `stable`
#    # channels. More info about channels here:
#    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/channels
#    # TODO: reset to `stable` when we've been manually reviewed: https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/request-for-classic-confinement-for-lazydocker/12155
#    grade: devel
#
#    # Snaps can be setup to follow three different confinement policies:
#    # `strict`, `devmode` and `classic`. A strict confinement where the snap
#    # can only read and write in its own namespace is recommended. Extra
#    # permissions for strict snaps can be declared as `plugs` for the app, which
#    # are explained later. More info about confinement here:
#    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/confinement
#    confinement: classic
#
#    # Your app's license, based on SPDX license expressions: https://spdx.org/licenses
#    # Default is empty.
#    license: MIT
#
#    # # Each binary built by GoReleaser is an app inside the snap. In this section
#    # # you can declare extra details for those binaries. It is optional.
#    # apps:
#
#    #   # The name of the app must be the same name as the binary built or the snapcraft name.
#    #   lazypodman:
#
#    #     # If your app requires extra permissions to work outside of its default
#    #     # confined space, declare them here.
#    #     # You can read the documentation about the available plugs and the
#    #     # things they allow:
#    #     # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces.
