// Package throttle provides functionality to limit the frequency with which code is called
//
// Throttling is of the Trigger() method and depends on the parameters passed (period, trailing).
//
// The period parameter defines how often the throttled code can run.  A period of one second means
// that the throttled code will run at most once per second.
//
// The trailing parameter defines what hapens if Trigger() is called after the throttled code has been
// started, but before the period is finished.  If trailing is false then these triggers are ignored.
// If trailing is true then the throttled code is executed one more time at the beginning of the next period.
//
// Example with period = time.Second and trailing = false:
//
//	Whole seconds after first trigger...|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|1|
//	Trigger() gets called...............|X| |X| | |X| | |
//	Throttled code gets called..........|X| | | | |X| | |
//
// Note that the second trigger had no effect.  The third Trigger() caused immediate execution of the
// throttled code.
//
// Example with period = time.Second and trailing = true:
//
//	Whole seconds after first trigger...|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|1|
//	Trigger() gets called...............|X| |X| | |X| | |
//	Throttled code gets called..........|X| | | |X| | | |
//
// Note that the second Trigger() causes the throttled code to get called once the first period is over.
// The third Trigger() will do the same.
