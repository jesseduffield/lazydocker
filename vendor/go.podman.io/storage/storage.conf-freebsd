# This file is is the configuration file for all tools

#  Note: The storage.conf file overrides other storage.conf files based on this precedence:

#      /usr/local/etc/containers/storage.conf
#      $HOME/.config/containers/storage.conf
#      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/storage.conf (If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)
# See man 5 containers-storage.conf for more information
# The "container storage" table contains all of the server options.

#  "private": it is equivalent to 0700.
#     All files/directories get set with 0700 permissions.  The owner has rwx
#     access to the files. No other users on the system can access the files.
#     This setting could be used with networked based homedirs.
#  "shared": it is equivalent to 0755.
#     The owner has rwx access to the files and everyone else can read, access
#     and execute them. This setting is useful for sharing containers storage
#     with other users.  For instance have a storage owned by root but shared
#     to rootless users as an additional store.
#     NOTE:  All files within the image are made readable and executable by any
#     user on the system. Even /etc/shadow within your image is now readable by
#     any user.
#
#   OCTAL: Users can experiment with other OCTAL Permissions.
#
#  Note: The force_mask Flag is an experimental feature, it could change in the
#  future.  When "force_mask" is set the original permission mask is stored in
#  the "user.containers.override_stat" xattr and the "mount_program" option must
#  be specified. Mount programs like "/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs" present the
#  extended attribute permissions to processes within containers rather then the
#  "force_mask"  permissions.
